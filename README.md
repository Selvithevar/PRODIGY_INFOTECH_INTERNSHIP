1. Cats and Dogs Classification using SVM:
This project involved building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. It was a fantastic introduction to the world of image classification and SVM algorithms.

2. House Price Predictions using Linear Regression:
Predicting house prices is a common machine learning task, and I had the opportunity to apply linear regression techniques to predict real estate prices.

3. Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means:
Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses, and I learned how to use K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on their shopping behavior.

4. Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN:
The code continues with defining and training a convolutional neural network model using Keras, and then evaluates its performance. Finally, it visualizes the model's performance using matplotlib.
This script is essentially a complete pipeline for image classification using a convolutional neural network. It loads the dataset, preprocesses the images, defines the model architecture, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and visualizes the results.
